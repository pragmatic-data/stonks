      Trades in all asset classes in portfolios hold on Interactive Broker.
      
      The trades are at position level (with the exception of CASH trades to exchange funds).
      The main types of trades are standard trades for whole securities and fractional trades.
      
      The Transaction Type column has some values (Withholding Tax, Other Fees) that overlap across categories.

      Trades are immutable transactions, so they SHOULD NOT have versions,
      BUT the export from IB has sometimes added the Underlying code for STOCK positions
      instead of keeping it null, so we end up with two versions (two HDIFF) even if the contents 
      are pretty much the same.
