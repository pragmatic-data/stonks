# In this file we document the models about POSITIONS on Interactive Brokers
# The main concepts are:
#  - OPEN POSITIONS - the position data as we get it from the IB reports, only open positions
#  - CLOSED POSITIONS - the positions with zeroed out values, once they are closed 
#  - (ALL) POSITIONS (ACCOUNT_POSITIONS) - the positions in the account, with correct open and closed states.

  - name: STG_IB_OPEN_POSITIONS
    description: |
      Positions in portfolios held on Interactive Broker as returned by IB exported reports.
      This model tracks the changes in the positions and cost basis, not in their current value.

      This model does not have closed positions, but only the open positions from the IB open position reports.
      This model DOES NO correctly represents the situation in a portfolio.

  - name: STG_IB_CLOSED_POSITIONS
    description: |
      Closed positions in portfolios held on Interactive Broker.
      This model calculates the closed positions from the open ones in the RAW_POSITIONS.
      
      The calculation is similar to detecting deletions: when we have a newer report without a position
      we consider the position closed and put the values for it to zero with the date of the next report.

      - dbt_utils.unique_combination_of_columns:          #-- MAX 1 EXACT version x eff date

  - name: STG_IB_ALL_POSITIONS
    description: |
      Open and closed positions in portfolios held on Interactive Broker.
      This model has only the positions and cost basis info, not in their current value.
      
      This model unions the closed positions to the open ones.
      This model therefore correctly represents the positions in a portfolio.

      There is one line in this STG model for each report that we have in the Landing Table
      where the positon was open plus one line when a position is closed.
      
      We do not need to load all reports (from CSV) in the LT to correctly identify changed or closed positions, 
      but the more reports we have the more precisely we identify when a position changed or was closed.

  - name: VER_IB_ALL_POSITIONS
    description: |
      This VER model adds the versioning info and validity time ranges to the HIST model.
      
      There is one row for each (reported) date when a change in a position is recognized
      and one row when a position has been closed, with the correct validity.
