      Individual cash transactions for DIVIDENDS in portfolios hold on Interactive Broker.
      
      In general for each divident payment there are multiple rows.
      Commonly there is one row for the Gross dividend and one for the tax withold, 
      but there can be no tax or the dividend can be split in real dividend and payment in liew (when someone else 
      is borrowing the title to short it) or there can be other costs, like ADR pass-through costs.

      Cash Transactions are immutable, so rows cannot be changed (execept for our manual restatements, if we want to do that).
      To change/fix a dividend payout after the initial transaction is recorded it is common that two new transactions
      are issued with the same settle date of the original transaction (when the dividend was payable), 
      but the record date of the time of the correction. 
      The first of the new TXs opposes the original TX and the second enters the correct information.

      The Transaction Type column explains the content of each row.
      The settle date is the effectivity date, i.e. when the information has to be accounted for.
      The report date is when the information arrived.

      Aggregated cash transactions by position and settlement date for DIVIDENDS in portfolios hold on Interactive Broker.
      
      Each row should account for one divided payment, detailing the gross, net and tax payments both
      in trading (FX) and base currency.

      Each row should group all different types of payment, taxes and costs for a single payment (settlement date),
      including fixes and restatements arrived later at any time.

          In general it should be the net dividend paid on the date, but on some dates there are just adjustments 
          (as the settlement dates are not properly aligned with the original dividend payment).
