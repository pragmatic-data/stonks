/** 
 * When we get SECURITIES from the POSTION REPORTS we set EFFECTIVITY at the end of the EXTRACTION PERIOD,
 * because in the past we got only one export at the end of a quarter or a month and the start is always the start of the year.
 *
 * The end of the period is often later than when a position was extabilshed and other events (like dividends) start to be visible. 
 * We have therefore decided to set as EFFECTIVITY DATE, only for the **first version** of a Reported Position,
 * at the START of the export period, instead of the end of it.
 *
 * Each Reported Positions still has the REPORT DATE telling when we exported it (that is also the end of the period),
 * besides the two calculated fields EXTRACTION_PERIOD_START and EXTRACTION_PERIOD_END that are even more explicit.
