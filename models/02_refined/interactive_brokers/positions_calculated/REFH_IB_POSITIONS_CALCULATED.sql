        ** NOTE on the POSITION_CALCULATED_HDIFF column
        *  To build the VER model on top of the REFH we need to pass an HDIFF column 
        *  that distinguishes between different versions of the entity.
        *  Given how we build the POSITIONS in this model the TX_ORDER_IN_POSITION column 
        *  perfectly fits the bill and it is as simple and efficient as we can ask.
        *  
        *  We could directly use the TX_ORDER_IN_POSITION column in the VER model,
        *  renaming it here to have a proper HDIFF name is for clarity, maybe an overkill 
        *  to satisfy the LSP => avoid questions from the readers of the VER model.
        *  
        *  Anyway this is a good opportunity to show two alternative ways to calculate HDIFFs in models
        *  1. by providing a list of culumn names 
        *  2. by putting the list of columns in a YAML file as a config for this model
        *     and referencing it here by using the config.get() function
