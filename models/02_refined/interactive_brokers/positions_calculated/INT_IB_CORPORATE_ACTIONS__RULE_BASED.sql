/** 
 *  This model uses a simple rule on SECURITY_SYMBOL to generate Corporate Action Transactions from Open Positions.
 *
 *  The rule looks for closed positins where the next row has the same SECURITY_SYMBOL, but different SECURITY_CODE.
 *  In such case we return two rows:
 *      - one row for the TX to close the old position (that was automatically closed in the Open Positions flow)
 *        This one is using the underlying automated closed position to source its data.
 *      - one row for the TX to open the new position with the new code
 *        This one is using the underlying new open position to source its data.
 *
 *  This works with these assumptions:
 *      - the Corporate Actions converts the securities 1 to 1, so the same amount that is closed is re-opened
 *      - the effectivity date is the same as the underlying open positions used to genrate the TXs
 *      - ?? the rule handles only long positions with close and reopen ?? TSLA ??
